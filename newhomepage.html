        <p>The history of HTML is very important in the history of the internet. It is a big reason as to why we are able to surf the web the way we are today. Let's dive into what HTML is.</p>
        <h2><u>Key Terms</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML</b> - HTML is referred to as HyperText Markup Language, the common markup language used to create Web pages. The structure of a Web page is described by HTML.</li>
            <li><b>Class</b> - One or more classes, separated by spaces, are present in HTML elements. By choosing elements based on their classes, you can style them with CSS.</li>
            <li><b>ID</b> - An ID attribute can be used to identify an HTML element. Each element should never contain more than one ID, and ID elements should always be specific to that one element.</li>
            <li><b>HRef</b> - Links use a href, which stores a URL and instructs the browser where to go.</li>
            <li><b>Body</b> - All of a page's content is contained in the body. It falls inside the general <html> element, following the <head> tag.</li>
    <h1><u>A Brief History</u></h1>
    <p>The abbreviation of HyperText Markup Language, HTML, is a markup language that permits the creation of webpages and was developed in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee. Its initial focus was to help arrange and link documents on the initial World Wide Web. With the continued growth in internet usage, the basic language that described scientific documents with titles, paragraphs, and links also needed to progress. HTML 2.0 was set as a standard in 1995 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) along with further updating enhancements to abilities and introducing new features. This work was then handed over to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintaining the released 4.01 version of HTML in 1999 as the de facto standard for a long period. In the late 2000s, development started on 5, which is a much more advanced version aimed at meeting contemporary responsive design and multimedia needs. Released in 2014, HTML5 set the groundwork for modern web development by enabling complex web applications, built-in video playback, and further support for external plugins.
