        <h1><u>How Was HTML Created?</u></h1>
        <p>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee was working for CERN where he recognized the need for a system to conveniently share and access research documents across different networks, leading him to develop HTML. At that time, documents were stored in silos, preventing ease of collaboration. Berners-Lee saw the potential to create an all-inclusive system that could integrate documents with hyperlinks, inspired by a concept known as hypertext – where text can be linked non-linearly. He went on to develop HTML, a simple yet powerful markup language that structured content with tags, to realize this dream. In addition, he built WorldWideWeb, the first web browser/editor, alongside the first web server that hosted and accessed the aforementioned documents.

HTML also served as a building block for the World Wide Web in collaboration with other technologies like HTTP and URLs. The initial version of HTML was basic yet powerful, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links which allowed almost anyone to create, navigate, and document online. The work done by Berners-Lee singlehandedly transformed digital communication as people could now easily access and share information. His decision to not restrict the core technologies of the web to only a few, but rather encourage collaboration and free access to the web’s core technologies allowed for rapid growth. The web has now established itself as a global platform for learning, communication, and commerce.
