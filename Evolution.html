        <h1><u>The Evolution of HTML</u></h1>
        <p>HTML has had many changes since its first variation in 1991 by Tim Bernes-Lee. This version was for simply formatting and linking text. In  1995, HTML 2.0 came about and would enhance already exhisting features. HTML 3.2 was introudced in 1997, and introduced more formatting options such as tables and scripting. Arriving in 1999, bringing in many CSS styles we were brought HTML 4.01. Lastly, after a hiatus we were brought HTML 5 in 2014 with features like video, canvas, audio , and a pleathora of other features that are very useful today. </p>
