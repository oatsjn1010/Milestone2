        <h1><u>What is HTML?</u></h1>
        <p>Hypertext markup language, or better known as HTML, is the prominent language used for developing and organizing content on sites. Unlike other existing languages such as JavaScript and Python that actually involve programming, HTML falls into the category of markup languages, as it utilizes tags created to “mark up” text, images, multimedia, and other pieces of information that need to be displayed in a certain way using a browser. Browsers use the tags, such as those that are used for paragraphs and hyperlinks, respectively, to look at the content and arrange it in a way that is easy to read and properly organized. In simpler terms, HTML is the basis of a webpage, as it shows many elements with their approximate places but does not provide construction elements style and functions.</p>
            <br>
        <p> HTML is simple, but its strength lies in its combination with other web technologies. For example, JavaScript may be added for dynamic behavior and interactivity, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used with HTML to manage the page's identity. HTML is important for the overall design of the website to customize it to the liking of the owner. HTML has adapted and progressed with modern technology, especially with HTML 5, with new semantic tags and more support for the user. This process modernizes HTML into a feature-rich platform for applications, rather than just a mechanism to display text.
